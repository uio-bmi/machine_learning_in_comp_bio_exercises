# Machine Learning in Computational Biology Exercises

This repository contains exercises for the machine learning part of the course.

## Exercise 1: Transcription Factor Binding Prediction

In this exercise, we will have three datasets consisting of DNA sequences which are labeled 0 or 1 if the transcription factor binds to them or 
not, respectively. We will run a few Python scripts to train the models and then examine the results to try to understand how the models work.

Datasets for this exercise were downloaded from https://github.com/QData/DeepMotif.
